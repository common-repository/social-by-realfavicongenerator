Craft the appearance of your site when your visitors share it on Facebook

== IMPORTANT ==

**This project has been renamed to (Resoc Social Editor)[https://wordpress.org/plugins/resoc-social-editor/]**

Please use Resoc Social Editor instead of Social by RealFaviconGenerator.

It has been developped by the same author, supports WordPress 5 / Gutenberg and has more features.

== Description ==

Would you like to know how your posts will look like when shared on Facebook by your visitors? This Facebook editor lets craft your OpenGraph metadata so *you* decide of your sharing design, not Facebook.

Will the title fit the space allocated by Facebook in its news feed? Will the description be truncated? Wonder no more, the editor shows you its final look, whatever it is on desktop, iPhone or Android smartphone.

You can even choose the format of the image Facebook will display. Again, you are in charge of the final aspect, not Facebook.

Using Yoast SEO? Perfect. We replace its classic Facebook OpenGraph editor with our.
